## Final Project for POLI100X: Quantitative Analysis of Congress

This is a project conducted for POLI100X at UCSD, FA23. 

### Executive Summary:

This research demonstrates the relationship between polarization and legislative
productivity in both chambers of Congress. We aimed to discover the effect of polarization on
the overall productivity in legislation, and whether or not the relationship between the two was
significant enough to be characterized as causal. For the purposes of the experiment, legislative
productivity is quantified as the amount of time a bill is spent in Congress from the time it is
introduced to the time both the Senate and the House pass it. The study employs data from
UCLAâ€™s Voteview database to quantify polarization in the Senate and the House of
Representatives, as well as data from Brookings Institute to encapsulate the legislative
productivity of both houses. In addition, our research utilized the data from 1947 to 2017 as the
datasets converged in these years. Implementing these datasets into our study, linear regression
models reveal that there is a significant and insignificant relationship between polarization and
legislative productivity in the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively. These
results suggest the impactful hindrance political polarization has on the overall productivity of
legislation in the United States government and the need for more research on this topic.
